## Hey there, I'm Ivo ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior software engineer at Thoughtworks and a Community Manager at DevParana.

As a Senior Software Engineer, my focus is to deliver as much value as possible considering my contraints, having in mind the best engineering practices and always prioritizing people.
I have strong knowledge with Java and PHP, applying techniques from Extremme Programming such as Automated Test, Teste Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Refactoring and Continuos Deployment (CD).
I have worked for many business domains and different company sizes, which allowed me to improve my communication as an important asset, allowing me to lead teams, solve conflicts and break the problem into smaller simples pieces.

As a community manager, I aim help people to connect through free events around the Parana's State. I've organized dozens of events for thousands of people, which provied me the opportunity to get in touch with a lot of interesting people.

**ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Im fluent English speaker and already work to USA based companies.**

âš¡Fun facts ablut my community mannager journey:
- I talked with Uncle Bob (Clean Code author) during an event I organized; We brought him to speak during our conference;
- I had lunch once with Woody Zuill (First person to come up with the MobProgramming concept);
